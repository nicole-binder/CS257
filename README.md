**Working Title:**
What is America Doing: Time Usage in the US

**By:**
Nicole Binder, Cole Dilanni, Maanya Goenka, and Emilia Katari

**Site Purpose:**
This site will enable individuals to easily view time usage statistics accross the US. The main intention is to view how time usage changes over time so users can predict future statistics about different demographics.

**Dataset Metadata:**
Sandra L. Hofferth, Sarah M. Flood, Matthew Sobek and Daniel Backman. American Time Use Survey Data Extract Builder: Version 2.8 [dataset]. College Park, MD: University of Maryland and Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2020. https://doi.org/10.18128/D060.V2.8 

(Accessed via IPUMS on 10 May 2020 from AMERICAN TIME USE SURVEY EXTRACT BUILDER https://www.atusdata.org)

**About:**
This dataset is from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). It contains information on how people in the United States spend their time in the years 2003 through 2018. Activities reported include paid work, child care, religious activities, volunteering, and socializing.

**External Source:**
ATUS-X: https://www.atusdata.org DOI: https://doi.org/10.18128/D060.V2.8 

**Terms of Use:**
The Terms of Use outlined by the ICPSR state that the data may be used for educational purposes, under the following stipulations:
"Subjects who participate in surveys and other research instruments distributed by ICPSR expect their responses to remain confidential. The data distributed by ICPSR are for statistical analysis, and they may not be used to identify specific individuals or organizations. Although ICPSR takes steps to assure that subjects cannot be identified, users are also obligated to act responsibly and not to violate the privacy of subjects intentionally or unintentionally."

(The full text of the Terms of Use may be found at ​https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/about/tou-violations.html​)

**Local Copy:**
Our copy of the dataset was downloaded from the link provided (via ATUS-X) on 10 May 2020. The local dataset is hosted on GitHub in the ​cs257s20-web-project-team_e repository in the
Data/ directory​

The extracted dataset is atus_00011.csv, along with the codebook codebook.pdf

ICPSR_24943-V2.zip contains the codebook, terms of use, and other miscellaneous information related to the dataset's metadata.
atuscps_0317.zip contains the ATUS-CPS data (part 5) from 2003-2017 in .dat, .do, .sas, and .sps data, in addition to an info.txt 

These files are uploaded zipped for storage space reasons. 
We also have access to the other parts of the data, but since the ATUS-CPS data will be required for geographic information, it's uploaded as an example (and because of limited storage space).

The ATUS-CPS data was downloaded from https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles_my.htm

**Audience:**
1) Businesses and Marketing Firms: This constitutes the set of users who would utilize the website information and data to learn more about time usage trends so that they can target marketing more effectively. 

2) Students: They could access the data to gather more information on the various time usage trends in the US as part of a research project or for a different educational purpose.

3) Educators: They can present the easily understandable graphics and datasets to students in a classroom environment as part of their curriculum or a topic they are teaching.

4) Data Researchers: They could access the website for more information on current demographic trends in the US pertaining specifically to time usage across the country's population. They could use it to support a claim they are making in a paper or to conduct further research into the topic. 

5) Politicians: They could use the website to gather more information about their constituencies and use that to determine how to formulate their campaigns to meet voter interests. 

6) Policymakers: They can utilize the website data to compare and contrast characteristics of different areas and regions in the country in order to guide their policymaking based on the demographics that prevail there. 

**Collaboration Plan:**
We will be using Zoom and/or email to communicate every week and make sure we are on track to finish our project by the expected deadline. We will be meeting on Sunday every week and hold each other accountable to finish the deliverables in a timely manner. We will be responsive on our Slack group chat (checking the group chat once everyday) and use that forum to inform each other of any emergencies that might come up. We have a Trello board that we collaborate on and will update our tasks on once we are finished with them. Tasks will be designated to group members on that board. These have not been completely fleshed out yet but will become clearer as we delve further into the project and become aware of our strong points and interests with the website.
