Name: Agatha Smith

Descriptor: Educator

Quote: "In an increasingly online world, I believe that proper data education is essential for every student."

Who is it? Agatha Smith is a 50-year-old middle school teacher who has taught the eighth grade at her local school in
Sacramento, CA for the past fifteen years. She previously had a background in communications and statistics, but decided
after finishing college that she would prefer to teach the younger generation than get a corporate job. 

Goals: Agatha wants to teach students to do basic research and analyze data at a basic level. She feels like it's 
important to use real data, so that students won't overgeneralize and will be more interested in their results. 

Attitude: Agatha wants a convenient location to pull lots of different data sets pertaining to her state (California) from,
so that she can give the location to her class and let them pick topics for a statistics project, but she doesn't want them
to be too difficult to understand, so the eighth graders don't have too much trouble with the topic.

Behavior: Agatha is a long-time browser of the Spurious Correlations website, and loves to keep up with her former students
via Facebook, but otherwise spends most of her time either working on lesson plans, grading, or working on her long-time hobby
of welding. It's very important to her that a website be easy to use - she doesn't want to have to spend a lot of effort learning
to navigate a site, and she doesn't want it to be an impediment for her students - but, as an expert in statistics, she's okay if
the data presented isn't in a particularly aesthetically pleasing form, so long as it's present and understandable. She tends to 
spend a long time on her lesson plans, so she generally takes a long time considering the pros and cons of using various websites
as part of class (if using such a website is required).
