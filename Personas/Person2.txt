district.

Attitude: Derek is interested in how the district has changed in the past years, 
and what if any issues he can discern from that knowledge.

visualizers. He is an avid problem-solver and will dive into any information full 
force. Derek usually shares things he finds on the internet with others to get 
confirmation of legitimacy and accuracy.
